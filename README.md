# HealthWhere

HealthWhere is a web application that retrieves information regarding any condition listed on the NHS Health A-Z website and also displays local NHS services that can help. Created with Node.js, HTML and CSS and made possible with the NHS and Google Maps APIs. This project was created to practice working with asynchronous data and APIs on the client and server side, as well as creating a comprehensive web application with a simple UI.
