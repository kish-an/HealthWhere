# HealthWhere

HealthWhere is a web application that retrieves information regarding any condition on the NHS Health A-Z website and also displays local NHS services that can help. Created with Node.js, HTML and CSS and made possible with the NHS, Mapbox and Postcodes.io APIs. This project was created to practice working with asynchronous data and APIs on the client and server side, web scraping and creating a basic web application with a simple UI.
